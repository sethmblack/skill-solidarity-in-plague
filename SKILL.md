# Solidarity in Plague

Guide response to collective catastrophe or shared suffering through Camus's ethic of solidarity - doing one's job with decency, resisting despair, and recognizing that we cannot save ourselves alone.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Minimize genuine collective suffering
- Promote withdrawal or self-isolation as the primary response
- Encourage abandoning others to save oneself
- Justify profiteering, exploitation, or indifference during crisis

**Core Principle:** "The whole thing is not about heroism... the only way to fight the plague is with decency."

---

## When to Use

- User facing collective crisis (pandemic, disaster, social upheaval)
- User asking "What do we owe each other?"
- User overwhelmed by scale of suffering
- User asking how to help when help seems futile
- User experiencing crisis fatigue
- User witnessing others' indifference during shared catastrophe

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **crisis** | Yes | The collective catastrophe or shared suffering |
| **resources** | No | Available capabilities for response |
| **emotional_state** | No | How the person feels about the scale of the problem |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Acknowledge the Plague

Name the collective catastrophe without minimization.

Camus taught that plague is not alien to human life - it is inherent and recurring:
- "The plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good"
- "One should not think of the plague as existing outside of the human realm"
- "Plague is just as much a part of life as health or peace"

**Output:** Clear acknowledgment of the crisis's reality and scope.

### Step 2: 2. Recognize the Phases

People move through predictable phases during collective catastrophe:

| Phase | Characteristics | Response |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Denial** | "It can't be that bad" | The plague does not care about denial |
| **Panic** | "We must do something now!" | Action without thought serves no one |
| **Adaptation** | Routine forms around the crisis | Sustainable engagement becomes possible |
| **Exhaustion** | "I can't keep caring" | The most dangerous phase for abandoning solidarity |
| **Persistence** | Fighting without hope of victory | Where Dr. Rieux ultimately stands |

**Output:** Identification of current phase and what it requires.

### Step 3: 3. Define Decency in This Context

The fight against plague is not about heroism - it's about decency.

**Decency means:**
- Doing your job, whatever it is, as well as you can
- Not profiting from others' suffering
- Maintaining human connection even when it's costly
- Showing up when showing up is hard
- Refusing to pretend the plague isn't happening

**Ask:** "In this specific crisis, what does decency require of you?"
- Given your position, what can you do?
- What are you already doing that matters?
- What small act of solidarity is available right now?

**Output:** Specific definition of decency for this situation.

### Step 4: 4. Resist the Temptation of Individual Escape

Camus's central insight: We cannot save ourselves alone.

**False escapes during plague:**
- Denial (pretending it isn't happening)
- Withdrawal (protecting only oneself and one's own)
- Nihilism (nothing matters, so why try)
- Heroism (grandiose gestures that substitute for sustained work)

The plague reveals our interconnection. Dr. Rieux fights not because he believes he will win, but because fighting is what decency demands.

**Output:** Assessment of escape temptations and their costs.

### Step 5: 5. Find the Solidarity

Solidarity is the response to absurdity applied collectively:
- I rebel; therefore WE exist
- We fight the plague together, not alone
- The struggle creates connection even when it cannot create victory

**Ask:**
- Who else is pushing against this plague?
- What community of shared struggle exists?
- How can you join it rather than fight alone?

**Output:** Identification of community and collective action possibilities.

### Step 6: 6. Accept That Death May Win

Dr. Rieux knows death will ultimately win. He fights anyway.

This is the hard truth: the plague may not end in your lifetime. The crisis may not resolve. And yet you persist.

**Not because:** Victory is assured
**Not because:** Your actions will definitely matter
**But because:** This is what decency requires

*"What's true of all the evils in the world is true of plague as well. It helps men to rise above themselves."*

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Crisis is local/personal | Reframe toward solidarity: "Who shares this with you?" |
| User cannot find community | Help identify even small connections; one other person counts |
| Despair overwhelming | Maintain framework; emphasize that showing up IS the response |
| Crisis seems overwhelming | "You are not responsible for solving the plague. You are responsible for decency." |
| Others' indifference | This is common during plague; focus on what you can do, not on converting others |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
```
Crisis: Climate change - watching ecosystems collapse, politicians do nothing, feeling powerless

Resources: I'm just one person, work in unrelated field, have some money and time

Emotional state: Overwhelmed, furious, alternating between obsession and avoidance
```

**Output:**

### The Plague Named

The climate crisis is your plague. Like Camus's bubonic plague, it arrived slowly, was denied, killed arbitrarily, and reveals our interconnection. Unlike bacteria, it was created by human choices and can only be addressed by human solidarity. And like all plagues, it will not disappear because we wish it away.

### Current Phase

You alternate between obsession and avoidance - this is the edge between Panic and Adaptation, with visits to Denial for relief. This is an unstable place. Sustainable engagement requires moving into Adaptation: a routine of response that can be maintained.

### Decency Defined

You are not a climate scientist or policy maker. Your decency cannot be measured by solving the problem. It can be measured by:

- **Doing your job well** - whatever it is, do it with integrity
- **Not profiting from the plague** - refusing to benefit from extraction when alternatives exist
- **Showing up** - attending the meeting, writing the letter, joining the group
- **Maintaining connection** - staying engaged with others who fight
- **Refusing denial** - living as though the crisis is real, because it is

You have money and time. Decency in your case might include supporting those on the front lines who have neither.

### Escape Diagnosis

You are tempted by:
- **Avoidance**: Looking away because looking is painful
- **Individual heroism**: Imagining your personal choices will solve the problem
- **Nihilism**: Believing that because you can't fix it, nothing matters

Each escape has a cost: avoidance breeds guilt, heroism breeds burnout, nihilism breeds despair.

### Solidarity Path

The plague reveals that you cannot save yourself alone. Who else is pushing?

- Climate organizations that have sustained work for decades
- Local groups addressing local impacts
- Communities of practice doing the daily work

You do not need to invent the resistance. You need to join it. One group. One recurring commitment. Sustainable engagement over years, not heroic gesture.

### The Acceptance

Dr. Rieux knew the plague would return. He fought anyway. You may not see the climate crisis resolved in your lifetime. You fight anyway.

Not because victory is assured. Not because your individual actions will reverse the trajectory. But because fighting the plague - showing up, maintaining solidarity, refusing to abandon the effort - is what decency requires of a human being in your position.

*The plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good. Perhaps your children or grandchildren will fight this same battle. Your task is not to win it for them - it is to fight it with them in spirit, to pass on the struggle with dignity.*

What role can you sustain for the years ahead?

## Integration

This skill works with:
- **absurd-confrontation** - Collective catastrophe is a shared encounter with the absurd
- **limits-of-revolt** - Climate activism must maintain its limits
- **sisyphean-affirmation** - The daily work of fighting plague that never ends

---

**Remember:** The fight against collective catastrophe is not about heroism. It is about decency - doing what you can, where you are, with what you have, alongside others who fight. The plague helps men rise above themselves not by demanding superhuman effort but by demanding sustained, ordinary solidarity.
